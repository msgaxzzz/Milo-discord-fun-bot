## üöÄ Getting Started

There are two ways to set up the bot: a one-line installer for new servers, or a manual setup for more control.

### Method 1: The Easy Way (One-Line Installer)
For a fresh Linux server, you can use this single command to download the installer script and run it automatically. It will check for dependencies, clone the repo, and set up the project structure for you.

## Installation:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/msgaxzzz/Milo-discord-fun-bot/main/install.sh | bash
```
---

## Method 2: Manual Installation
Follow these steps to set up the bot on your local machine or server.

## 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/msgaxzzz/Milo-discord-fun-bot.git
cd Milo-discord-fun-bot
```

Install Dependencies
The project's dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. Install them using pip:
# It's recommended to use python3 and pip3 on most systems

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Create the Database Folder
The bot uses an SQLite database. You need to create a folder for it manually.
```bash
mkdir database
```

Running the Bot
Once the configuration is complete, start the bot with:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
